# 🔨 FORGE — AI Game Development Studio

> Where AI agents hammer out games.

FORGE is a multi-agent AI game development studio, forked from [Hive](https://github.com/EtroxTaran/hive). While Hive builds web applications with 17 AI agents, FORGE adapts the same proven orchestration framework for game development with 20 specialized agents.

## What is FORGE?

FORGE is **not** a game engine. It's a **team of AI agents** that collaborates to build games — just like a real game studio, but powered by LLMs.

- 🎮 **20 AI Agents** covering every game development role
- 🏗️ **Unreal Engine 5.5+** as primary engine (Godot as alternative)
- 🧠 **Shared infrastructure** with Hive (monitoring, knowledge base, consensus engine)
- 🔄 **Full SDLC** from concept to live service

## Relationship to Hive

```
Shared Foundation (Orchestration, MCP, Dashboard, Knowledge Base, Consensus)
├── HIVE — Web/Fullstack (17 agents, React/Hono)
└── FORGE — Game Dev (20 agents, Unreal/C++)
```

~60% shared infrastructure. Different agent loadouts for different domains.

## Current Status

🚧 **Draft** — Architecture defined, implementation pending.
